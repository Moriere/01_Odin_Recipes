    <p>Not too hard, but not too raw either. These eggs are the best option available to those who want to complicate their breakfast every morning.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A simple egg</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Put the egg in a small saucepan.</li>
        <li>Add enough water so the egg is completely covered</li>
        <li>Put the egg on the stove at max heat</li>
        <li>Keep boiling for <strong><em>two minutes and a half</em></strong>. Not three, not two. Use a countdown timer if possible.</li>
        <li>Drain the boiling water from the saucepan and add cold water immediately when the countdown is over.</li>
        <li>Serve the egg like shown image. The only correct way is by breaking the shell on the flattest extreme of the egg. It's important <strong><em>not to empty the shell contents into a cup.</em></strong></li>
        <li>Add salt to taste.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
